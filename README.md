# metaboard

Interactive drawing boards in Roblox.

## Getting Started
To sync this into your own Roblox place file, you can use [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 6.2.0.

Open this repository in your terminal and run

```bash
rojo serve
```

Then go to the Rojo plugin in Roblox Studio and click `Connect`.
This will add all of the backend code. Finally, copy the `Whiteboard.rbxmx`
file into your Workspace (make copies and edit this board as you please).

Further configuration can be found in `ReplicatedStorage.MetaBoardCommon.MetaBoardConfig`.

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
